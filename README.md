FlutterBegining

## Getting Started

My first project in Flutter to test the language and find a clean architecture.

lib/
|- main.dart
|- routes.dart
|- screens/
|- util/
|- widgets/
|- data/
|- services/


screens:Contains the screens of your application. All files from here get imported into routes.dart
util:Contains the utilities/common functions of your application
widgets:Contains the common widgets for your applications. For example, Button , TextField etc.
routes.dart:Contains the routes of your application and imports all screens.
