# First flutter app

FlutterBegining

## Getting Started

My first project in Flutter to test the language and find a clean architecture.

lib/
|- main.dart
|- routes.dart
|- screens/
|- util/
|- widgets/
|- data/
|- services/


  1. **screens:** Contains the screens of your application. All files from here get imported into routes.dart
  2. **util:** Contains the utilities/common functions of your application
  3. **widgets:** Contains the common widgets for your applications. For example, Button , TextField etc.
  4. **routes.dart:** Contains the routes of your application and imports all screens.
